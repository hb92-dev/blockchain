## Instructions

To get this working, first we should start a blockchain server, by running the following commands:

`export FLASK_APP=node_server.py`</br>
`flask run --port 8000`

One instance of our blockchain node is now up and running at port 8000

Now, we have to run the application (use different terminal session) </br>
`python run_app.py`

The application should be up and running at *localhost:5000*
